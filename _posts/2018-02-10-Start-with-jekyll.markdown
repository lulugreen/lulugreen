You want to get started with Jekyll  on MacOS ? Here is what you can do  
Configuration:  
`MacOS:  Sierra 10.12`  
`Jekyll: 3.7.2`
# 1.  Go to the [offical website][officalWebsite]
You should see this:  
![instructions]( https://ibin.co/3rPA7OPjusBp.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Before you do all this, you will probably need to install *Ruby*, in order to use `gem`

# 2.  Make sure gem is available

Open a terminal and Type `gem -v`  

It should prompt some numbers, like `2.7.4`  
If not, you need to make *gem* command available from everywhere in you mac, [click here][gem] to know how in 1 minute  

# 3.  Make sure *jekyll* is not already installed

Type `jekyll -v`  

It should say:  
`-bash: jekyll: command not found`


# 4.  Install *jekyll*

`sudo gem install jekyll bundler`  
Type your password when prompted

# 5.  create your first *jekyll* website called 'exampleWebsite'

Type `jekyll new exampleWebsite`


# 6.  Run and browse 'exampleWebsite'

Type `cd exampleWebsite`  
Then type `bundle exec jekyll serve`

Open a browser (Chrome for instance) and go to url [http://127.0.0.1:4000/][url]

that's it !

# 7.  Further reading

I recommend the official doc, and also some videos like this [Youtube Tutorial][youtube]
